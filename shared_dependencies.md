1. Dependencies: All the files will share the same dependencies, which will be listed in the "package.json" file. These dependencies will include "pnpm", "typescript", and possibly others such as "@types/node" for TypeScript type definitions.

2. Exported Variables: The "index.ts" file will likely export a main function that is used to initialize the plugin. The "packageInstaller.ts" and "typesChecker.ts" files may export helper functions that are used by the main function.

3. Data Schemas: There may be a shared data schema for the configuration of the plugin, which could be defined in a separate file and imported where needed.

4. Function Names: The "index.ts" file will likely contain a main function, such as "initPlugin". The "packageInstaller.ts" file may contain a function like "installPackage", and the "typesChecker.ts" file may contain a function like "checkTypes".

5. Message Names: If the plugin uses events or messages to communicate between different parts of the code, these message names would be shared between the files. For example, there might be a "packageInstalled" message that is sent from "packageInstaller.ts" to "index.ts".

6. No DOM elements: As this is a Node.js project and not a front-end project, there will be no shared id names of DOM elements.

7. TypeScript Config: The "tsconfig.json" file will contain the configuration for the TypeScript compiler, which will be shared across all TypeScript files in the project.
